# School District Analysis #

This analysis was done to compare math and reading outcomes of students in various school environments. The percentage of students who passed math, reading, and both, were broken down by school type, school size, type of school, and the student's year. Due to unspecified academic dishonesty involving the scores from 9th graders at Thomas High School, this analysis will primarily focus on how removing the affected data changed the analysis.

## District Summary ##

After removing the math and reading scores from Thomas High School 9th graders, the entire district analysis changed as follows:

* The average math score fell by 0.1%
* The percentage of students passing math fell by 0.2%
* The average reading score fell by <0.1%
* The percentage of students passing reading fell by 0.3%
* The overall passing percentage fell by 0.1%, 

The discrepency between how little the average reading fell, despite the percentage of students passing reading falling by 0.3% could possibly be explained by the removed reading scores being over-represented with students who barely passed, thus their grades would fall closer to the average.
